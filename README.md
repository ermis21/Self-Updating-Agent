# Self-Updating Agent

# In Development

The Self-Updating Agent is a Python-based application designed to autonomously update its own codebase. This functionality is particularly useful for long-running processes that require the ability to enhance or fix themselves without manual intervention.

## Features

- **Automated Self-Updates**: The agent can fetch and apply updates to its own codebase during runtime.
- **Code Execution**: It can execute code snippets, allowing for dynamic behavior adjustments.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Incorporates a chatbot capable of understanding and processing natural language inputs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ermis21/Self-Updating-Agent.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Self-Updating-Agent
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the agent, run:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The agent will initialize and begin monitoring for updates and processing inputs as configured.

## Configuration

Configuration settings can be adjusted in the `config.json` file. This includes parameters for update intervals, execution permissions, and other operational settings.
